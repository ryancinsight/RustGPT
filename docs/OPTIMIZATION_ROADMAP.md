# Optimization Roadmap: Incremental Feature Implementation

## Current Status

**Baseline Performance** (Excellent! ✅):
- **Loss**: 0.387
- **Output**: "Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism over long geological time periods"
- **Gradient Stability**: L0: 7-11 (very well controlled)
- **Architecture**: Pre-LN + RMSNorm + SwiGLU + CoPE + GQA + MoH + Bidirectional LARS

## Philosophy: Incremental Adaptive Features

**Key Insight**: Our successful features (MoH, sliding window) use **adaptability**, not hardcoded values.

**Strategy**: Add one adaptive feature at a time, test thoroughly, maintain gradient stability.

## Roadmap

### Stage 1: Adaptive MoE with Dynamic Routing ⭐ PRIORITY

**Goal**: Replace hardcoded top-2 routing with adaptive top-p routing

**Rationale**:
- MoH success proves adaptability works in our architecture
- Research shows 0.7% improvement + 10% fewer parameters
- Addresses root cause of previous MoE failure

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add top-p routing to Router (60 min)
2. Add dynamic loss (entropy minimization) (30 min)
3. Test with threshold p=0.4 (60 min)
4. Tune threshold if needed (30 min)

**Success Criteria**:
- Loss ≤ 0.40 (maintain baseline)
- Average experts: 1.5-2.0 (adaptive)
- Gradient stability: L0 in 7-15 range
- Output quality: Coherent

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Risk**: Medium (new routing mechanism)
**Reward**: High (10% parameter reduction + potential performance gain)

### Stage 2: Gradient Stability Enhancements

**Goal**: Further improve gradient flow and stability

**Options**:

#### 2A. Gradient Checkpointing
**Benefit**: Reduce memory, enable larger batch sizes
**Implementation**: Cache activations at strategic points
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low

#### 2C. Warmup Schedule Optimization
**Benefit**: Smoother training start
**Implementation**: Tune warmup epochs, try linear/exponential schedules
**Time**: 30 min
**Risk**: Very low

**Recommended**: 2C (30 min)

### Stage 3: Loss Rate Optimization

**Goal**: Reduce loss below 0.35

**Options**:

#### 3A. Learning Rate Schedule Tuning
**Current**: Cosine annealing from 1.5e-6 to 1.0e-6
**Experiment**:
- Increase max LR to 2.0e-6
- Extend warmup to 20 epochs
- Try cyclic LR (SGDR with restarts)

**Time**: 1-2 hours (multiple runs)
**Risk**: Low

#### 3B. Batch Size Scaling
**Current**: Likely small batch
**Experiment**: Increase batch size + scale LR accordingly
**Time**: 1 hour
**Risk**: Low

#### 3C. Data Augmentation
**Idea**: Augment training data with paraphrases, synonyms
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium

**Recommended**: 3A (1-2 hours)

---

### Stage 4: Architectural Enhancements

**Goal**: Improve model capacity and expressiveness

**Options**:

#### 4A. Adaptive Layer Depth (Mixture-of-Depths)
**Idea**: Some tokens skip layers (early exit), others use all layers
**Benefit**: Efficient inference, adaptive computation
**Research**: "Mixture-of-Depths" (Raposo et al., 2024)
**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Risk**: High

#### 4B. Sliding Window Attention Enhancement
**Current**: Fixed window size
**Idea**: Adaptive window size based on token importance
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium

#### 4C. Expert Specialization Tracking
**Idea**: Monitor which experts specialize in which patterns
**Benefit**: Insights for architecture improvements
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low

**Recommended**: 4C first (insights), then 4B (2-3 hours)

---

### Stage 5: Advanced Optimizations

**Goal**: Push performance to state-of-the-art

**Options**:

#### 5A. Layer-Wise Adaptive Thresholds (MoE)
**Idea**: Different p threshold per layer (L0: p=0.6, L14: p=0.2)
**Benefit**: Match expert count to layer needs
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low (builds on Stage 1)

#### 5B. Learned Threshold Predictor
**Idea**: Learn p per token instead of fixing it
**Benefit**: Maximum adaptability
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium

#### 5C. Multi-Scale Training
**Idea**: Train on multiple sequence lengths simultaneously
**Benefit**: Better generalization
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk**: Medium

**Recommended**: 5A (1-2 hours)

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Changes
- Adaptive MoE (Stage 1): New routing mechanism
- Mixture-of-Depths (Stage 4A): Complex architecture change

**Mitigation**: 
- Implement incrementally
- Test thoroughly after each change
- Keep baseline code for comparison
- Document all hyperparameters

### Medium-Risk Changes
- Adaptive sliding window (Stage 4B)
- Learned threshold predictor (Stage 5B)

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple version
- Add complexity gradually
- Monitor gradient stability closely

### Low-Risk Changes
- Gradient norm monitoring (Stage 2B)
- Warmup schedule (Stage 2C)
- LR schedule tuning (Stage 3A)
- Expert tracking (Stage 4C)
- Layer-wise thresholds (Stage 5A)

**Mitigation**: Minimal - these are well-understood techniques

## Rollback Strategy

**If any stage fails**:
1. Document failure mode (loss, gradients, output)
2. Revert to previous working version
3. Analyze logs for root cause
4. Adjust hyperparameters or implementation
5. Retry with modifications

**Git Workflow**:
```bash
# Before each stage
git add -A
git commit -m "Stage X: [description] - Baseline loss: [value]"

# If stage fails
git revert HEAD
# or
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Long-Term Vision

### After Roadmap Completion

**Potential Future Directions**:
1. **Scale Up**: Increase model size (layers, dimensions)
2. **New Architectures**: Mamba, RWKV, RetNet
3. **Multi-Task Learning**: Train on multiple tasks simultaneously
4. **Distillation**: Compress large model to smaller efficient model
5. **Quantization**: INT8/INT4 for faster inference
