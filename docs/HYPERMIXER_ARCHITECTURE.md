# HyperMixer Architecture Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the HyperMixer architecture into the RustGPT codebase as an alternative to the standard Transformer architecture. The implementation is based on the paper "HyperMixer: An MLP-based Low Cost Alternative to Transformers" (ACL 2023).

## Architecture Comparison

### Transformer Architecture
- **Token Mixing**: Self-attention mechanism using Q, K, V matrices
- **Complexity**: O(n²) in sequence length
- **Strengths**: Proven architecture, excellent performance on many tasks
- **Weaknesses**: Quadratic complexity, high memory usage for long sequences

### HyperMixer Architecture
- **Token Mixing**: Dynamic MLP weights generated by hypernetworks
- **Complexity**: O(n) in sequence length
- **Strengths**: Linear complexity, more parameter efficient, input-dependent mixing
- **Weaknesses**: Newer architecture, less extensively tested

## Key Components

### 1. Hypernetwork (`src/hypernetwork.rs`)
The hypernetwork is a small MLP that generates weights for the token-mixing layer dynamically based on the input content.

**Architecture**:
```
Input (mean-pooled sequence) → Linear → ReLU → Linear → Generated Weights
```

**Key Innovation**: Unlike static MLPMixer, the mixing weights adapt to the input, making the model more expressive while maintaining efficiency.

### 2. Token Mixing MLP (`src/token_mixing.rs`)
Mixes information across tokens in the sequence using weights generated by the hypernetwork.

**Process**:
1. Mean-pool input sequence across tokens
2. Generate mixing weights via hypernetwork
3. Transpose input to (embedding_dim, seq_len)
4. Apply generated MLP weights across sequence dimension
5. Transpose back to (seq_len, embedding_dim)
6. Add residual connection

### 3. Channel Mixing MLP (`src/channel_mixing.rs`)
Standard feedforward network that mixes information across embedding dimensions for each token independently.

**Architecture**:
```
Input → Linear → ReLU → Linear → Residual → Output
```

Similar to transformer feedforward layers but conceptually part of the HyperMixer design.

### 4. HyperMixer Block (`src/hypermixer.rs`)
Complete block combining token and channel mixing with layer normalization.

**Architecture**:
```
Input
  ↓
TokenMixing (with residual)
  ↓
LayerNorm
  ↓
ChannelMixing (with residual)
  ↓
LayerNorm
  ↓
Output
```

## Configuration System

### Model Configuration (`src/model_config.rs`)
Provides a unified configuration interface for both architectures:

```rust
pub enum ArchitectureType {
    Transformer,
    HyperMixer,
}

pub struct ModelConfig {
    pub architecture: ArchitectureType,
    pub embedding_dim: usize,
    pub hidden_dim: usize,
    pub num_layers: usize,
    pub hypernetwork_hidden_dim: Option<usize>,
    pub max_seq_len: usize,
}
```

### Model Builder (`src/model_builder.rs`)
Factory pattern for constructing networks based on configuration:

```rust
pub fn build_network(config: &ModelConfig, vocab: &Vocab) -> Vec<LayerEnum>
```

Automatically constructs the appropriate architecture based on `config.architecture`.

## Usage

### Switching Between Architectures

In `src/main_hyper.rs`, simply change the architecture type:

```rust
// Use Transformer
let architecture = ArchitectureType::Transformer;

// Use HyperMixer
let architecture = ArchitectureType::HyperMixer;

let config = match architecture {
    ArchitectureType::Transformer => {
        ModelConfig::transformer(EMBEDDING_DIM, HIDDEN_DIM, 3, MAX_SEQ_LEN)
    }
    ArchitectureType::HyperMixer => {
        ModelConfig::hypermixer(EMBEDDING_DIM, HIDDEN_DIM, 3, MAX_SEQ_LEN, None)
    }
};

let network = build_network(&config, &vocab);
let mut llm = LLM::new(vocab, network);
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning

**Transformer**:
- `embedding_dim`: Dimension of token embeddings
- `hidden_dim`: Hidden dimension of feedforward layers
- `num_layers`: Number of transformer blocks

**HyperMixer**:
- `embedding_dim`: Dimension of token embeddings
- `hidden_dim`: Hidden dimension of channel mixing layers
- `num_layers`: Number of HyperMixer blocks
- `hypernetwork_hidden_dim`: Hidden dimension of hypernetwork (default: embedding_dim / 4)

## Design Principles Applied

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component (hypernetwork, token mixing, channel mixing) has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Architecture is open for extension (new architectures can be added) but closed for modification (existing code preserved)
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level LLM depends on Layer trait abstraction, not concrete implementations

### CUPID Principles
- **Composable**: Components can be combined in different ways
- **Unix Philosophy**: Each module does one thing well
- **Predictable**: Clear interfaces and behavior
- **Idiomatic**: Follows Rust best practices
- **Domain-based**: Architecture reflects the problem domain

### GRASP Principles
- **Information Expert**: Each component manages its own state
- **Low Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between components
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together

### Additional Principles
- **CLEAN**: Clear, Logical, Efficient, Actionable, Neat code organization
- **SSOT (Single Source of Truth)**: Configuration centralized in ModelConfig
- **SPOT (Single Point of Truth)**: Each architectural decision made in one place

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Efficiency
- HyperMixer uses fewer parameters than Transformer for equivalent capacity
- Linear complexity in sequence length vs. quadratic for Transformer
- Hypernetwork adds minimal overhead (typically < 5% of total parameters)

### Computational Efficiency
- Token mixing: O(n × d²) vs. O(n² × d) for attention
- More efficient for long sequences (n > d)
- Better cache locality due to MLP operations

### Training Considerations
- Both architectures use Adam optimizer
- HyperMixer may require slightly different learning rates
- Gradient flow through hypernetwork requires careful initialization

## Testing

Run tests to verify both architectures:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific architecture tests
cargo test test_build_transformer_network
cargo test test_build_hypermixer_network
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Benchmarking**: Add comprehensive performance comparisons
2. **Hybrid Architectures**: Combine attention and HyperMixer layers
3. **Optimizations**: SIMD vectorization, GPU acceleration
4. **Advanced Features**: Multi-head token mixing, learned hypernetwork architectures
5. **Ablation Studies**: Analyze impact of hypernetwork size, mixing strategies

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing Transformer implementation preserved unchanged
- Original `main_hyper.rs` functionality maintained
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Model checkpoints remain compatible (architecture-specific)

## Contributing

When adding new architectures:
1. Implement the `Layer` trait for all components
2. Add new variant to `ArchitectureType` enum
3. Update `build_network()` in `model_builder.rs`
4. Add corresponding tests
5. Update this documentation
