# Mixture-of-Heads (MoH) vs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Comprehensive Comparison

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Purpose**: Compare MoH and MoE, analyze compatibility, and provide recommendations for RustGPT

---

## Executive Summary

**Mixture-of-Heads (MoH)** and **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** are complementary techniques that operate on different layers:
- **MoH**: Routes tokens to different **attention heads** (reduces attention compute)
- **MoE**: Routes tokens to different **FFN experts** (scales model capacity)

**Key Finding**: They can work together but target different goals. MoH is about **efficiency**, MoE is about **scale**.

**Recommendation for RustGPT**: Implement **MoH first** (aligns with efficiency focus), consider MoE separately later (if scaling is needed).

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1 Mixture-of-Heads (MoH)

**What it does:**
- Dynamically selects which attention heads to activate per token
- Operates within the attention layer
- Reduces compute by skipping inactive heads

**Architecture:**
```
Input → Router → Select Top-K Heads → Attention → Weighted Sum → Output
```

**Key characteristics:**
- **Layer**: Attention (multi-head attention)
- **Goal**: Reduce compute within existing capacity
- **Parameter increase**: Minimal (~0.5% for router)
- **Activation rate**: 50-90% of heads
- **Routing**: Per-token, learned
- **Speedup**: 5-25% (depending on activation rate)

**Example:**
```
8 attention heads, activate 6 per token (75%)
→ 25% compute reduction in attention
→ ~10% overall speedup (attention is ~40% of compute)
```

### 1.2 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

**What it does:**
- Routes tokens to different expert FFN networks
- Operates within the FFN layer
- Scales model capacity without proportional compute increase

**Architecture:**
```
Input → Router → Select Top-K Experts → Expert FFNs → Weighted Sum → Output
```

**Key characteristics:**
- **Layer**: FFN (feed-forward network)
- **Goal**: Scale model capacity (more parameters)
- **Parameter increase**: Massive (8× for 8 experts)
- **Activation rate**: 12-25% (Top-1 or Top-2 of 8)
- **Routing**: Per-token, learned
- **Speedup**: 40-50% (but with 8× parameters)

**Example:**
```
8 FFN experts, activate Top-2 per token (25%)
→ 75% compute reduction in FFN
→ ~45% overall speedup (FFN is ~60% of compute)
→ But 8× FFN parameters (massive memory increase)
```

### 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

**Standard Transformer Layer:**
```
y = x + Attention(x)
z = y + FFN(y)
```

**With MoH (Attention):**
```
Attention(x) = Σ(i=1 to h) g_i H^i W_O^i
where g_i = routing score (0 for inactive heads)
```

**With MoE (FFN):**
```
FFN(y) = Σ(i=1 to n) g_i Expert_i(y)
where g_i = routing score (0 for inactive experts)
```

**With Both (MoH + MoE):**
```
y = x + Σ(i=1 to h) g_i^attn H^i W_O^i        (MoH)
z = y + Σ(i=1 to n) g_i^ffn Expert_i(y)       (MoE)
```

## 3. Can They Work Together?

### 3.1 Compatibility Analysis

**YES, they are COMPLEMENTARY:**
- Operate on different layers (attention vs. FFN)
- Independent routing decisions
- Orthogonal optimizations
- Can be combined in the same model

**Architecture with both:**
```
Transformer Layer:
  1. Input
  2. LayerNorm
  3. Attention with MoH ← Routes heads
  4. Residual connection
  5. LayerNorm
  6. FFN with MoE ← Routes experts
  7. Residual connection
  8. Output
```

### 3.2 Combined Speedup Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- Attention = 40% of total compute
- FFN = 60% of total compute
- MoH activates 75% of heads
- MoE activates 25% of experts (Top-2 of 8)

**Compute breakdown:**

| Configuration | Attention Compute | FFN Compute | Total | Speedup |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Standard** | 100% × 0.4 = 0.40 | 100% × 0.6 = 0.60 | 1.00 | 1.0× |
| **MoH only** | 75% × 0.4 = 0.30 | 100% × 0.6 = 0.60 | 0.90 | 1.11× |
| **MoE only** | 100% × 0.4 = 0.40 | 25% × 0.6 = 0.15 | 0.55 | 1.82× |
| **MoH + MoE** | 75% × 0.4 = 0.30 | 25% × 0.6 = 0.15 | 0.45 | 2.22× |

**Key insight:** Speedup is **ADDITIVE** (not multiplicative) because they operate on different layers.

**Combined savings:**
- MoH saves: 10% overall
- MoE saves: 45% overall
- **Combined: 55% overall (2.22× speedup)**

### 3.3 Memory Impact

**MoH memory:**
- Router parameters: ~20KB (negligible)
- Runtime overhead: <1%
- **Total: +1%**

**MoE memory:**
- 8 experts × FFN size = 8× FFN parameters
- Example: FFN with 4× hidden_dim, 8 experts = 32× hidden_dim parameters
- **Total: +800% (dominates)**

**Combined memory:**
- Dominated by MoE (MoH is negligible)
- **Total: +800%**

## 4. Challenges of Combining MoH + MoE

### 4.1 Training Complexity

**Challenge:**
- Two routing systems to train simultaneously
- Two load balance losses to tune (β_attn, β_ffn)
- Potential interaction between routing decisions
- More hyperparameters to tune

**Mitigation:**
- Staged training: Train MoH first, then add MoE
- Separate learning rates for each router
- Careful tuning of load balance weights
- Warm-up period for both routers

### 4.2 Implementation Complexity

**Challenge:**
- Need to implement both routing systems
- Need to coordinate load balancing
- Need to handle gradients for both
- More code to maintain and debug

**Mitigation:**
- Shared routing infrastructure (Top-K, load balance)
- Modular design (separate MoH and MoE modules)
- Comprehensive testing for interactions
- Clear documentation

### 4.3 Distributed Training

**Challenge:**
- MoE requires expert parallelism (multi-GPU/TPU)
- MoH is simpler (single device)
- Combined: Inherits MoE's distributed complexity

**Mitigation:**
- Use existing MoE frameworks (DeepSpeed, Megatron)
- Start with small-scale experiments
- Gradual scaling to larger models

### 4.4 Diminishing Returns

**Challenge:**
- MoE already gives 45% savings (huge!)
- MoH adds another 10% on top (smaller marginal gain)
- Is the added complexity worth 10% more savings?

**Analysis:**
- If you have MoE, MoH adds 10% / 55% = 18% relative improvement
- If you have MoH, MoE adds 45% / 90% = 50% relative improvement
- **MoE has bigger impact, but requires massive memory**

## 5. Recommendations for RustGPT

### 5.1 Strategic Analysis

**RustGPT's current focus:**
- Attention innovations (CoPE, Adaptive Window, GQA)
- Efficiency optimizations (zero-cost abstractions)
- Clean architecture (SOLID, CUPID, GRASP)
- Minimal memory overhead

**RustGPT's constraints:**
- Likely single-device training (no distributed infrastructure)
- Memory-constrained (not targeting billions of parameters)
- Focus on research and experimentation

### 5.2 Recommendation: Implement MoH First

**✅ RECOMMENDED: Mixture-of-Heads (MoH)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Aligns with focus**: Attention innovations (CoPE, Adaptive Window, now MoH)
2. **Low complexity**: 6-week implementation, low risk
3. **Minimal memory**: +1% overhead (fits constraints)
4. **Proven**: Works with existing features (GQA, CoPE, Adaptive Window)
5. **Clean design**: Enum-based, follows SOLID/CUPID principles
6. **Immediate value**: 5-25% speedup without infrastructure changes

**Timeline:**
- 6 weeks implementation
- Low risk
- Immediate deployment

### 5.3 Consider MoE Separately (Later)

**⏳ FUTURE CONSIDERATION: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**

**When to consider:**
- Scaling to billions of parameters
- Have distributed training infrastructure
- Have multi-GPU/TPU resources
- Need massive model capacity

**Requirements:**
- Distributed training framework (DeepSpeed, Megatron)
- Multi-GPU/TPU setup
- 8× memory capacity
- 12+ weeks implementation
- High complexity, high risk

**Not recommended now because:**
- RustGPT doesn't have distributed infrastructure
- Memory increase (8×) is prohibitive for current scale
- Complexity doesn't align with clean architecture focus
- MoH provides sufficient efficiency gains

### 5.4 Don't Combine Initially

**❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: MoH + MoE (Initially)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Too complex**: 20+ weeks, very high risk
2. **Diminishing returns**: MoH adds only 10% on top of MoE's 45%
3. **Memory dominated by MoE**: MoH's efficiency lost in MoE's scale
4. **Infrastructure required**: Distributed training, multi-GPU
5. **Maintenance burden**: Two routing systems to maintain

**When to reconsider:**
- After MoH is stable and proven
- After distributed infrastructure is in place
- When scaling to very large models (>10B params)
- When 55% savings justifies the complexity

## 7. Comparison with Other Techniques

### 7.1 Efficiency Techniques Comparison

| Technique | Target | Savings | Memory | Complexity | RustGPT Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Adaptive Window** | Attention (spatial) | 0-50% | +0% | Low | ✅ Implemented |
| **MoH** | Attention (channel) | 10-25% | +1% | Low | 📋 Planned |
| **GQA** | Attention (KV cache) | 25-50% | -50% | Low | ✅ Implemented |
| **MoE** | FFN (capacity) | 40-50% | +800% | High | ❌ Not planned |

### 7.2 Complementary Techniques

**Can be combined:**
- ✅ Adaptive Window + MoH (multiplicative speedup: 2-3×)
- ✅ GQA + MoH (both reduce attention compute)
- ✅ CoPE + MoH (each head uses its own CoPE)
- ✅ MoH + MoE (operate on different layers)

**Optimal combination for RustGPT:**
```
Attention Layer:
  - CoPE (context-aware positions)
  - GQA (grouped KV heads)
  - Adaptive Window (dynamic window size)
  - MoH (dynamic head selection)
  
FFN Layer:
  - SwiGLU (current)
  - MoE (future, if scaling is needed)
```
