# Adaptive Attention Heads: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Status**: ✅ Research Complete - Ready for Implementation Decision  
**Recommendation**: **IMPLEMENT** Mixture-of-Heads (MoH)

---

## TL;DR

Adaptive attention heads (MoH) dynamically select which attention heads to activate per token, achieving **5-8% inference speedup** and **0-2% accuracy improvement** with minimal overhead. Fully compatible with all existing RustGPT features (GQA, CoPE, Adaptive Window). **Recommended for implementation.**

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Research Results

**Primary Paper**: "MoH: Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention" (Skywork AI, Oct 2024, arXiv:2410.11842)

| Model | Heads Active | Performance | Speedup |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| MoH-ViT-B | 75% | 84.9% (vs 84.8%) | 1.3× |
| MoH-ViT-B | 50% | 84.7% (vs 84.8%) | 2.0× |
| MoH-LLaMA3-8B | 75% | 64.0% (vs 61.6%) | 1.3× |

**Key Insight**: Not all attention heads are equally important. Dynamic selection improves both efficiency and accuracy.

### 2. How It Works

```
Standard Multi-Head Attention:
  Output = Σ(i=1 to h) H^i W_O^i

Mixture-of-Heads (MoH):
  Output = Σ(i=1 to h) g_i H^i W_O^i
  
  where g_i = routing score (0 for inactive heads)
```

**Two-Stage Routing:**
1. **Shared Heads** (always active): Capture common knowledge
2. **Routed Heads** (Top-K selection): Specialize for specific patterns
3. **Weighted Summation**: Adds flexibility vs. standard summation

**Load Balance Loss**: Prevents routing collapse (all tokens → same heads)

### 3. Compatibility with RustGPT

| Feature | Compatible? | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| GQA | ✅ Yes | Activate KV head if ANY Q head in group is active |
| CoPE | ✅ Yes | Each selected head uses its own CoPE instance |
| RoPE | ✅ Yes | Apply RoPE to selected heads only |
| Sliding Window | ✅ Yes | Selected heads use window masking |
| Adaptive Window | ✅ Yes | **Orthogonal mechanisms - multiplicative speedup!** |
| RMSNorm | ✅ Yes | No interaction |
| SwiGLU | ✅ Yes | No interaction |

### 4. Adaptive Window vs. Adaptive Heads

**These are COMPLEMENTARY, not competing:**

| Aspect | Adaptive Window | Adaptive Heads |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **What** | Which tokens to attend to | Which heads to use |
| **Dimension** | Spatial | Channel |
| **Overhead** | ~0% | ~1-2% |
| **Savings** | 0-50% | 10-50% |
| **Combined** | **Multiplicative speedup: 2-3×** |

**Example:**
- Adaptive Window: 50% tokens → 2× speedup
- Adaptive Heads: 75% heads → 1.33× speedup
- **Combined: 2× × 1.33× = 2.66× speedup**

## Proposed Design

### Enum-Based Architecture

Following RustGPT's `PositionalEncodingType` pattern:

```rust
pub enum HeadSelectionStrategy {
    /// All heads always active (backward compatible)
    AllHeads,
    
    /// Mixture-of-Heads: dynamic head selection
    MixtureOfHeads {
        num_shared_heads: usize,           // Always active (e.g., 2/8)
        num_active_routed_heads: usize,    // Top-K selection (e.g., 4/6)
        load_balance_weight: f32,          // Prevent collapse (0.01)
    },
    
    /// Static pruning: first K heads (for comparison)
    StaticPruning {
        num_active_heads: usize,
    },
}
```

### Configuration Example

```rust
// Conservative defaults
config.head_selection = HeadSelectionStrategy::MixtureOfHeads {
    num_shared_heads: 2,              // 25% of 8 heads
    num_active_routed_heads: 4,       // 67% of 6 routed heads
    load_balance_weight: 0.01,        // Standard from paper
};

// Total active: 2 shared + 4 routed = 6/8 heads (75%)
```

## Performance Analysis

### Memory Impact

**Router Parameters:**
- Example (8 heads, 2 shared, 512 dim): ~20KB
- **Negligible** compared to attention weights (millions of params)

**Runtime Memory:**
- Routing scores: batch_size × seq_len × num_heads × 4 bytes
- Example (batch=2, seq=1024, heads=8): 64KB (temporary)
- **Total overhead: <1%**

### Compute Impact

**Router Overhead:**
- 3 matrix multiplications + 2 softmax + Top-K selection
- **~1-2% of attention compute**

**Attention Savings:**
- 75% heads active → 25% compute reduction
- Attention is ~30-40% of total model compute
- **Net savings: 7-10% of total compute**

**Expected Speedup:**
- **Inference: 5-8%** (net of routing overhead)
- **Training: 3-5%** (net of routing + load balance)

### Accuracy Impact

- **75% heads**: +0% to +2% accuracy
- **50% heads**: -0.1% to +0.5% accuracy
- **Weighted summation**: Adds flexibility, can improve accuracy

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Routing Collapse** | Medium | High | Load balance loss (proven effective) |
| **Training Instability** | Low | Medium | Warm-up period, lower router LR |
| **GQA Incompatibility** | Low | Medium | Proper KV head masking, tests |
| **Gradient Flow Issues** | Low | Low | Straight-through estimator (STE) |
| **Overhead > Savings** | Very Low | Low | Profile carefully, optimize |

**Overall Risk**: **LOW** - MoH paper demonstrates stable training across multiple domains
